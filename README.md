# CNN--CIFAR-100
This code will train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-100 dataset. This is a dataset full of images to train a machine learning model on. 
This file will train a CNN on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The CNN will be trained to label images based off of what it sees. This is a very difficult task, so this model
has been created with a very simple design.
